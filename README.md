## Contents used for the ROS Developers Day 2023 ros2_control presentation

In this hands-on presentation, we demonstrate how to set up a mobile manipulator with ros2_control in steps. First, we take a robot mobile base and demonstrate setting up ros2_control simulation for it in the URDF. Once done, a robot arm will be added to the mobile base, turning it into a mobile manipulator robot. The existing ros2_control configuration will be adjusted to accommodate for the new robot parts. Finally, the rosject concludes with a demonstration in Gazebo moving the robot using some off-the-shelf ros2_control controllers.

Attendees will learn

  * how to prototype a mobile manipulator with URDF and ros2_control
  * how to configure a gazebo simulation with a given URDF and ros2_control
